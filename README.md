‚Ä¢  Cloud Storage Services:

‚Ä¢	Amazon S3: Provides scalable object storage. You can use AWS SDKs or libraries like aws-sdk to interact with S3.
‚Ä¢	Google Cloud Storage: Similar to S3, but part of Google Cloud Platform. Use @google-cloud/storage to interact with it.
‚Ä¢	Microsoft Azure Blob Storage: Offers scalable storage with integration through Azure SDKs.

‚Ä¢  Image Hosting Services:

‚Ä¢	~~Cloudinary: Provides an image and video management service with APIs for uploading, storing, and manipulating images. It also offers free tiers and easy integration.~~
‚Ä¢	Imgur: A popular image hosting service with a straightforward API. Good for smaller projects or testing.
‚Ä¢	Flickr: Offers image hosting with API access. It's more oriented towards photo-sharing but can be used for hosting as well.
 
‚Ä¢  Custom Hosting:

‚Ä¢	Your Own Server: You can host images on your own server or infrastructure. This gives you full control but requires more setup and maintenance.
‚Ä¢	CDN Services: Using Content Delivery Networks like Cloudflare or Fastly can help cache and serve images more efficiently.
‚Ä¢  Integrated Hosting with CMS:
‚Ä¢	WordPress: If using WordPress as a CMS, you can use its media library to host images.
‚Ä¢	Strapi: A headless CMS that can manage and serve media files.

## (4) Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sifzerda/ImageUp.git
cd snake
npm install imageup
npm run start
```

Image hosting through Firebase Cloud API. Keys and authentication protected by firebase config js and .env file. 

process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY isn't recognized; you have to put:

```bash
  apiKey: import.meta.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: import.meta.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: import.meta.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: import.meta.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: import.meta.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: import.meta.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
```
inside the firebase config file.

.env file:
```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=[...]
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=[...]
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=[...]
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=[...]
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=[...]
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=[...]
```

## (5) Usage
